# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients:

*   **For the Pie:**
    *   4 bananas, sliced
    *   394g caramel or dulce de leche
    *   300ml double cream
    *   Dark chocolate (optional), for garnish

*   **For the Pastry:**
    *   100g butter, chilled (plus extra for greasing)
    *   200g plain flour
    *   1 medium egg, separated
    *   1 tbsp golden caster sugar

## Method:

1.  **Make the Pastry Case:** In a food processor, pulse butter and flour until crumbly. Add egg yolk and sugar, pulse, then add very cold water tablespoon by tablespoon until the dough comes together. Knead gently into a smooth ball, wrap in cling film, and chill for 30 minutes.
2.  **Bake the Pastry:** Preheat oven to 190°C/170°C fan/gas 4. Grease a 23cm loose-bottomed fluted tart tin. Roll out the chilled pastry and line the tin, leaving a 0.5cm edge. Line with baking parchment and baking beans/rice. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove paper and beans, brush with egg white, and bake for another 15-20 minutes until crisp and golden. Cool completely.
3.  **Assemble the Pie:** Spread half of the caramel over the cooled pastry case. Layer the sliced bananas on top. Cover with the remaining caramel.
4.  **Finish and Serve:** Whip the double cream until thick and billowy. Spoon over the top of the tart. To serve finely grate over a 1-2 pieces of dark chocolate to garnish.
